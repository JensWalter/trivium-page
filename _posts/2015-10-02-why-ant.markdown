I was looking for the build technology for the trivium project and could easily narrow it down to the usual suspect (usual for Java projects).

So there was Maven, Gradle and Ant.

I'm not going into detail on what each of those frameworks can do and cannot do, because there are plenty of other resources out there which do a good job comparing those frameworks.

First off, since the project is hosted on github the obvious choice for CI was travis-ci. This service is pretty well known and seems to cover what is necessary for the job.

All the above mentioned technologies are support by travis. So this was the first and most important criteria.
After that I tried to figure out the state of the client side.

Since I'm developing in intelliJ I was looking for something that is natively supported in that environment. In here we have Maven and Ant. Gradle is also support, but only through plugins.

Second stop was eclipse. Here we have again Ant support out-of-the-box and gradle and maven support as plugin.

To be really IDE independent I had to do stuff in Ant. This would be the only technology which has support anywhere, cloud and on-premise.

So Ant it is.
